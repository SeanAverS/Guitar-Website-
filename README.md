# Guitar Website

A Website that reviews the guitars I own. I wanted to showcase how I would format and present info on a website; That is something that is minimal, easy to navigate, and gets straight to the point of the Wesbite itself. 

What I learned 

- Use Web Design Principles to create pleasing website
- How to use media queries to format text
- Use background imgs as a guide for a websites color scheme

Improvements 
- Seperate page descriving the purpose and of this website
- Chose Background Imgs that don't disrupt the text in anyway 
- Include Animations on page load to create visual interest
