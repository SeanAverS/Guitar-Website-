# Guitar Website

A Website that reviews the guitars I own. I wanted to showcase how I would format and present info on a website; That is something that is minimal, easy to navigate, and gets straight to the point. 

What I learned 

- Use Web Design Principles to create pleasing website
- How to use media queries to format text
- Use background imgs as a guide for a websites color scheme

Improvements 
- Seperate page describing the website purpose
- Chose Background Imgs that don't disrupt the text in anyway 
- Include Animations on page load to create visual interest

# Installation
1. Clone the repo your machine - `git clone`
2. Navigate to the project dir - `cd/Guitar-Website`
3. Install dependencies - `npm install`
4. Run project - `npm start`
